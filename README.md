Augmented-reality-game

A technology that calculates the position and angle of the camera image in real time and adds corresponding images, videos and 3D models. The goal of this technology is to set the virtual world on the screen and interact with the real world.

Augmented reality technology not only shows the real world information, but also shows the virtual information at the same time. The two kinds of information complement and overlap each other. In visual augmented reality, users can see the real world surrounded by a helmet-mounted display, which combines the real world with computer graphics.

Augmented reality technology includes multimedia, three-dimensional modeling, real-time video display and control, multi-sensor fusion, real-time tracking and registration, scene fusion and other new technologies and means. Augmented reality provides information that is different from human perception in general.

Our game uses mobile camera to reflect the real scene and augmented reality technology to realize the simulated shooting game.
